Dataset Description for Students: 
Census Income Data
This dataset, extracted from the 1994 U.S. Census Bureau database, is designed for binary classification tasks. 
The goal is to predict whether a personâ€™s income exceeds $50,000 per year (>50K) or not (<=50K),

based on various demographic and economic factors. The dataset includes both continuous and categorical attributes,
making it a great exercise in handling mixed data types in machine learning.

Data Overview:

Total Instances: 48,842 (after cleaning, 45,222 instances)
Training Set: 32,561 instances
Test Set: 16,281 instances
Classes: >50K, <=50K
Probability of >50K: ~24%
Probability of <=50K: ~76%

Features:

Age: Continuous.
Workclass: Categorical (Private, Self-employed, Government, etc.).
Education: Categorical (e.g., Bachelors, HS-grad).
Education Number: Continuous (represents years of education).
Marital Status: Categorical (Married, Divorced, etc.).
Occupation: Categorical (e.g., Tech-support, Sales).
Relationship: Categorical (e.g., Husband, Wife).
Race: Categorical (White, Black, Asian, etc.).
Sex: Categorical (Male, Female).
Capital Gain: Continuous.
Capital Loss: Continuous.
Hours-per-week: Continuous.
Native Country: Categorical (e.g., United States, Mexico, Canada).
Learning Objectives:
Classification Task: Predict whether an individual earns more than $50K per year using demographic and economic features.
Algorithms to Explore:
Decision Trees (C4.5, ID3)
Naive Bayes
k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Neural Networks (if covering deep learning)
Performance Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.

Why This Dataset?
Real-World Data: Derived from U.S. Census data, it provides an opportunity to work with actual demographic and economic features.
Imbalance in Classes: With only ~24% of individuals earning more than $50K, this dataset introduces students to the challenge of working
with imbalanced data.
Handling Missing Data: Students will need to decide how to treat missing values or unknowns, providing practice in data cleaning.
Mixed Data Types: The dataset contains a combination of continuous and categorical features, offering experience in feature engineering and handling different data formats.
