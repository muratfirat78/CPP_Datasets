Bulb Manufacturer,"A light bulb manufacturer claims that its energy saving light bulbs last on average 60 days. A sampling of size 49 is collected from the production output with a mean of 56.5 days. Using confidence level 0.05, can we statically reject the claim of the manufacturer? Assume that the standard deviation of bulb lifetime is 9 days."
New Supplier,"The deviation in target length of the parts from the new supplier must be smaller than the target value of 1.5 mm to change the current supplier. We want to find statistical evidence that the parts of the new supplier have significantly less deviation to change the supplier. A sampling of size 45 is collected from the products of the new supplier with a mean of  1.2 mm. Using confidence level 0.01, can we statically reject the null hypothesis? Assume that the standard deviation of the products of the current supplier is 0.4 mm. Can we reject the null hypothesis in the favour of the new supplier?"
Contamination of food 1,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sets acceptable levels of foreign substances that end up in our food and drink. The acceptable level for insect fragments in peanut butter is 3 fragments per 10 grams. We are interested in finding problematic products in market; i.e. the food sampling that significantly contains fragments more than allowed in the regulation. A sampling of size 50 is collected from the products of a food producer with a mean of 3.6 fragments per 10 grams. Using confidence level 0.05, can we statically reject the null hypothesis? Assume that the standard deviation of all products is √3. Can we reject the null hypothesis to penalize the food producer?"
Contamination of food 2,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sets acceptable levels of foreign substances that end up in our food and drink. The acceptable level for insect fragments in peanut butter is 3 fragments per 10 grams. A sampling of size 20 is collected from the products of a food producer with a mean of 3.6 fragments per 10 grams. Using confidence level 0.05, can we statically reject the null hypothesis? Assume that the standard deviation of all products is 1.73. Can we reject the null hypothesis to penalize the food producer?"
Job performance,Jane has just begun her new job as on the sales force of a very competitive company. In a sample of 32 sales calls it was found that she closed the contract for an average value of $108. Test at 5% significance that the population mean is at least $100 against the alternative that it is less than 100 dollars. Assume that standard deviation of all sales done in company is 12 dollars. Company policy requires that new members of the sales force must exceed an average of $100 per contract during the trial employment period. Can we conclude that Jane has met this requirement at the significance level of 95%?
Testing expensive goggles,"Jeffrey, as an eight-year old, established a mean time of 16.43 seconds for swimming the 25-yard freestyle, with a standard deviation of 0.8 seconds. His dad, Frank, thought that Jeffrey could swim the 25-yard freestyle faster using goggles. Frank bought Jeffrey a new pair of expensive goggles and timed Jeffrey for 15 25-yard freestyle swims. For the 15 swims, Jeffrey’s mean time was 16 seconds. Frank thought that the goggles helped Jeffrey to swim faster than the 16.43 seconds. Conduct a hypothesis test using a preset α = 0.05."
Machine repair decision,"A manufacturer of salad dressings uses machines to dispense liquid ingredients into bottles that move along a filling line. The machine that dispenses salad dressings is working properly when 8 ounces are dispensed. Suppose that the average amount dispensed in a particular sample of 35 bottles is 7.91 ounces and assume that the standard deviation of all samples is 0.173 ounces. Is there evidence that the machine should be stopped, and production wait for repairs? The lost production from a shutdown is potentially so great that management feels that the level of significance in the analysis should be 99%."
Man Weight,"The municipality of a town made a questionnaire to find evidence to the claim that the mean average weight of men in town is greater than 100kgs and assume that the standard deviation of all men in town is 15kgs. 30 men are chosen with an average weight of 112.5 Kgs. Using hypothesis testing, check if there is enough evidence to support the claim. The confidence interval is given as 95%."
Public Opinion About President,"On May 16, 1994, Newsweek reported the results of a public opinion poll that asked: “From everything you know about Bill Clinton, does he have the honesty and integrity you expect in a president?” (p. 23). Poll surveyed 518 adults and 233, or 0.45 of them (clearly less than half), answered yes. Could Clinton’s adversaries conclude from this that only a minority (less than half) of the population of Americans thought Clinton had the honesty and integrity to be president? "
Owning cell phone,"Marketers believe that 92% of adults own a cell phone. A cell phone manufacturer believes that number is actually lower. In a sample of 200 adults, 87% own a cell phone. At the 1% significance level, determine if the proportion of adults that own a cell phone is lower than the marketers’ claim."
Dieters and exercisers,"In order to obtain an evidence that is statistically significant, two samplings are done from dieters and exercisers. The weight loss in a certain period of time is measured in the samples. 42 dieters are included in first sample with a mean loss of 5.9 kg and standard deviation 4.1 kg. 47 exerciser are selected in second sample with a mean loss of 4.1 kg and standard deviation 3.7 kg."
Do women eat less with men?,"The researchers reported the following sample statistics. In a sample of 45 women dining with other women, the average number of calories ordered was 850, and the standard deviation was 252. In a sample of 27 women dining with men, the average number of calories ordered was 719, and the standard deviation was 322. Here the two populations are “women eating with women” (population 1) and women eating with men (population 2). The variable is the calories in the meal. We test the following hypotheses at the 5% level of significance."
Brides younger than grooms?,"Joon believes that 50% of first-time brides in the United States are younger than their grooms. She performs a hypothesis test to determine if the percentage is the same or different from 50%. Joon samples 100 first-time brides and 53 reply that they are younger than their grooms. For the hypothesis test, she uses a 1% level of significance."
Having 3 cell phones,"Suppose a consumer group suspects that the proportion of households that have three cell phones is 30%. A cell phone company has reason to believe that the proportion is not 30%. Before they start a big advertising campaign, they conduct a hypothesis test. Their marketing people survey 150 households with the result that 43 of the households have three cell phones."
Ratio of owning a cell phone,"Marketers believe that 92% of adults in the United States own a cell phone. A cell phone manufacturer believes that number is actually lower. 200 American adults are surveyed, of which, 174 report having cell phones. Use a 5% level of significance. State the null and alternative hypothesis, find the p-value, state your conclusion."
Students trained by different teachers,"Within a school district, students were randomly assigned to one of two Math teachers - Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Jones. After the assignment, Mrs. Smith had 30 students, and Mrs. Jones had 25 students. At the end of the year, each class took the same standardized test. Mrs. Smith's students had an average test score of 78, with a standard deviation of 10; and Mrs. Jones' students had an average test score of 85, with a standard deviation of 15.Test the hypothesis that Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Jones are equally effective teachers. Use a 0.10 level of significance. (Assume that student performance is approximately normal.)"
LAB-Question1,". A dietician claims that adults in a country consume an average of 1500 calories per day. A researcher believes that the average calorie consumption is higher. They collected data from a random sample of 30 adults and find that the sample mean is 1600 calories, with a sample standard deviation of 150 calories. At a significance level of 0.05, can the researcher conclude that the average calorie consumption is higher than 1500 calories?"
LAB-Question2,"A manufacturer of a new type of battery claims that their batteries last an average of 40 hours under continuous use. A consumer testing agency wants to investigate this claim. They randomly select 20 batteries and find that the sample mean lifespan is 38.5 hours, with a sample standard deviation of 3 hours. At a significance level of 0.02, can the agency conclude that the manufacturer's claim is false?"
LAB-Question3,"1.	A political campaign claims that at least 55% of voters in a certain city support their candidate.   A random sample of 300 voters was taken, and it was found that 150 voters supported the candidate. At the 5% significance level, test whether there is enough evidence to reject the campaign's claim."
LAB-Question4,"A national health organization claims that 65% of adults in a certain country get the recommended amount of daily exercise. A local health department believes this percentage is lower in their region. They conduct a random survey of 250 adults in their region and find that 150 of them meet the recommended exercise guidelines. At a significance level of 0.05, can the local health department conclude that the national organization's claim is false for their region?"
LAB-Question5,"The Acme Company has developed a new battery. The engineer in charge claims that the new battery will operate continuously for at least 7 minutes longer than the old battery.To test the claim, the company selects a simple random sample of 100 new batteries and 100 old batteries. The old batteries run continuously for 200 minutes with a standard deviation of 20 minutes; the new batteries, 200 minutes with a standard deviation of 40 minutes. Test the engineer's claim that the new batteries run at least 7 minutes longer than the old. Use a 0.05 level of significance. (Assume that there are no outliers in either sample.)"
LAB-Question6,"The local baseball team conducts a study to find the amount spent on refreshments at the ball park. Over the course of the season they gather simple random samples of 100 men and 100 women. For men, the average expenditure was $200, with a standard deviation of $40. For women, it was $190, with a standard deviation of $20. The team owner claims that men spend at least $7 more than women. Assume that the two populations are independent and normally distributed."
